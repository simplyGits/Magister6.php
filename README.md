Magister6.php
=============

# OUTDATED, use <a href="https://github.com/magister-api/magister">Magister-api's magister</a> #

Easy to use, flexible PHP library for the Magister 6 API.

It doesn't manipulate any responses, except for adding functions (such as homework (basic filtering)).

By not changing any responses you can handle the "pure" data from Magister yourself. It doesn't force anything and gives you (and your app) total freedom.

It can be used in cron jobs, to give json response to a mobile app or to tweet all your grades. :-)
